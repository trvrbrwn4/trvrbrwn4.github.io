			<h2>About me</h2>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>I started my creative journey about six years ago when I started looping musical samples online. I spent hours sorting through their pre selected loops just to piece together a catchy track. After many months I was tired of the limits I had with the site, and decided to move forward with my production skills. I downloaded Logic Pro 9, and started off doing the same thing I was doing online; arranging loops. I had no clue how to work a synthesizer, or what a compressor did. Que YouTube and countless hours of reading and practicing, eventually leading me to my current position. I now have many friends from all across the globe that I talk with production with, I consistently participate in many online communities and am also working on pushing my own brand into the spotlight.
					<br><br>
				During the same time about four years ago, I also dove into programming. It all started in math class when one of my classmates showed me a program he had written on his own calculator. I was blown away, I had never expected programming to exist on the same tool I added numbers on! I spent a lot of time learning from my friend and looking things up online, ultimately becoming very familiar with the BASIC programming language that my calculator used. Over the next few years I enrolled in web design classes at school and even participated in the Ken Garff Code To Success program, learning a vast amount of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I now spend time coding websites for fun, making a wide amount of websites for various things. I have made the likes of informational sites, portfolios and games.
				<br><br>
				I have never had any formal classes for Photoshop, but my high school photography and mixed media classes taught a few aspects of the program. Not to mention I have been messing around with Photoshop for over seven years and have acquired a wide knowledge of how to use it. I have plans to become certified in it when I get the money for the Adobe class.
