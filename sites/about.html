			<h3>About me</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>I started my creative journey around mid-2011 when I started looping musical samples online. I spent hours sorting through their pre selected loops just to piece together a catchy track. After many months I was tired of the limits I had with the site, and decided to move forward with my production skills. I downloaded <strong>Logic Pro 9</strong>, and started off doing the same thing I was doing online; arranging loops. I had no clue how to work a synthesizer, or what a compressor did. Que YouTube and countless hours of reading and practicing, eventually leading me to my current position. I now have many friends from all across the globe that I talk with production with, I consistently participate in many online communities and am also working on pushing my own brand into the spotlight.
			<br><br>
			During the same time around mid-2013, I also dove into programming. It all started in math class when one of my classmates showed me a program he had written on his own <strong>calculator</strong>. I was blown away, I had never expected programming to exist on the same tool I added numbers on! I spent a lot of time learning from my friend and looking things up online, ultimately becoming very familiar with the <strong>BASIC programming</strong> language that my calculator used. Over the next few years I enrolled in web design classes at school and even participated in the <strong>Ken Garff Code To Success</strong> program, learning a vast amount of <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>. I now spend time coding websites for fun, making a wide amount of websites for various things. I have made the likes of informational sites, portfolios and games.
			<br><br>
			I have never had any formal classes for <strong>Photoshop</strong>, but my high school photography and mixed media classes taught a few aspects of the program. Not to mention I have been messing around with Photoshop for over seven years and have acquired a wide knowledge of how to use it. I have plans to become certified in it when I get the money for the Adobe class.
